NLDT is a corpus of 80 Dutch texts from expository texts (encyclopedias and science news web pages) and persuasive genres (fund-raising letters and commercial advertisements), which were annotated for rhetorical and genre-specific discourse structure, and lexical cohesion with the goal of creating a gold standard for further research. The annotations are based on a segmentation of the texts into elementary discourse units that takes into account cues from syntax and punctuation.  

## DISRPT 2021 shared task information

For the DISRPT 2021 shared task, train/dev/test partitions were balanced for genre. Syntactic parses in UD were produced using Stanza. The data contains no split EDUs, which were prevented in a handful of cases through some reordering of clauses in the original RST data. These segment orders were retained in the 2021 shared task data.
