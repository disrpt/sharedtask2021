## Introduction

﻿The RST Spanish-Chinese Treebank is a corpus of specialized texts in Spanish and their parallel texts in Chinese. All the texts are annotated manually with discourse relations under the theoretical framework Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988). RSTTool (O’Donnell, 2000) is used to annotate this corpus. The annotation results are saved by rstWeb (Zeldes, 2016). 

In total, 100 texts are included in this corpus. The genres of these texts are: (a) scientific abstract; (b) advertisement; (c) news and (d) announcement. The topics of the corpus are: (a) terminology; (b) culture; (c) language; (d) economy; (e) education; (f) art and (g) international affairs.

## DISRPT 2021 shared task information

Automatic parses were added using Stanza's pretrained Spanish Ancora model, with some additional postprocessing to resolve sentence splitting errors. This dataset contains discontinuous discourse units (split 'same-unit').
