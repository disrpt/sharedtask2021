## DISRPT 2021 shared task information

For the DISRPT 2021 shared task on elementary discourse unit segmentation, only the 11 open text genres are included (to obtain data in the remaining genre, containing Reddit forum discussions which is not included in the shared task, see the corpus website). The data follows the normal division into train, test and dev partitions used for other tasks (e.g. for the conll shared task on UD parsing).  

POS tags and syntactic parses are the UD version of the manually annotated gold data. 

### Notes on segmentation

GUM RST guidelines follow the RST-DT segmentation guidelines for English, according to which most clauses, including adnominal and nested clauses are discourse units. This dataset contains discontinuous discourse units (split 'same-unit').
